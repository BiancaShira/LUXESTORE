Extend the existing Next.js application with dynamic multi-store support and theme-based colors.

⚠️ Do NOT recreate the project.
⚠️ Do NOT change existing core functionality.
Only add the missing features described below.

🏬 Dynamic Stores (NO HARDCODING)

Add a Store model to the existing Prisma schema if it does not exist.

Each store must have:

name

slug (unique, used in URL)

color (optional hex value)

isActive

🌐 Dynamic Routing (Next.js)

Implement a dynamic route using app/[store]/page.tsx

Fetch store data using the slug

If the store does not exist or is inactive, return a 404

Display only products belonging to that store

🎨 Store-Based Colors

Use Tailwind CSS

Apply store color dynamically using CSS variables

Example:

--store-accent: #9333ea;


Use this color for:

Buttons

Headings

Price highlights

🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard – Store Management

Add a “Stores” section in the Admin Dashboard

Admin can:

Create a new store (name, slug, color)

Enable / disable store

Saving a store must:

Instantly make it available at /{slug}

Require no redeploy

📦 Product Assignment

Update product creation/editing so products can be assigned to a store

Ensure inventory, cart, checkout, and payments work per store

🔒 System Rules

Do NOT hardcode store names or routes

All store logic must come from the database

Adding a new store must NOT require restarting the app
